The programs in this directory are experimental only - I have included them
only to show both my progress and experimentation when I was initially cre-
ating the Blast! Library. None of the programs in this directory are intended
as final versions, nor are they intended to document the Blast! Library. Use
them at your own risk!

Seriously - These programs probably won't harm your machine, but some people
out there got confused, and were having trouble understanding where the
documentation was concerning the Blast! Library, and were trying to use these
routines instead. Don't! These routines are NOT part of the Blast! Library.
They are here for reference only.

Thank you.
