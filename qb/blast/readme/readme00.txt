   The Blast! Library is provided to the QuickBasic/QBASIC community at no
   charge. In other words, it is freeware. I only place one condition on its
   use within any program(s) you may write. I ask that you include my name,
   and the name of the library (Blast!) within the credits of your program.
   Something similar to "Graphics routines created using the Blast! Library
   by Andrew L. Ayers" will work. That is all I ask. If you do create some-
   thing with this library, send me a copy or let me know so I can download
   it. Thank you, and have phun!

Questions? Comments?
--------------------

If you have any questions regarding this library, or any comments about it, or
any suggestions on routines you would like to see, send an email to "andrewa@
indirect.com". I can't guarantee a reply to everyone, but I will try to get a
response back to you as soon as I can find the time. Thanks.
