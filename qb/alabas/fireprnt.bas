' Description : FirePrint! - Custom text print subroutine for
'               VGA Mode 13
' Written by  : Andrew L. Ayers

'
' This little routine allows you to place a "burning" text
' string on the mode 13 screen. This routine was based on
' a routine by Martin Lindhe. Both are essentially the same,
' though this one is cleaner. Remember, the better the machine,
' the better the effect. Also, smaller strings will look better.
'
' You may use this routine in any manner you like, as long
' as you give Mr. Lindhe and myself credit in an appropriate
' manner.
'
' I wish to thank Martin Lindhe for providing the inspiration
' to do this routine.

'
FOR t = 0 TO 63: PALETTE t, t: NEXT t
'
' Call the routine once for a simple "flame" effect,
' or over and over (as done here) for a great "burning"
' effect! Use uppercase for best effect.
