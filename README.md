# Vintage Experiments #

### About ###

Here you will find my various experiments, projects, and failures from the 
distant past. Oh yeah, this stuff is old; so old, as I was going through and
compiling it, I was shocked by both how terrible it was in many cases, as well
as how interesting (and even a bit prescient) in others.

For most of this stuff, if you are able to get it to work, more power to ya! Some,
but not all of it, has appeared in one form or another on the internet and possibly
elsewhere. Some of it is just some old code I dug up - maybe you'll find it useful?
I figured I would throw it up on my github in case anyone was interested.

From what I can tell and/or remember - most of the C/C++ code is for TurboC for
DOS, and/or maybe Allegro C (?). The QB stuff should work in QBasic 1.1 and QB4.5
for DOS (and you will want to run it under DOS - DOSBox will probably work ok too).
The VB stuff is likely all for VB5 and/or VB6 - I do know there was a piece in 
there too that was meant to be compiled by VisualC++ 5 (???) - not sure. Any 
assembler is 80x86 based.

As a final note, this will be the first time in many ages that the Prometheus 
Engine has been seen, as well as the source code to my game Swarm! - so enjoy!
